In the code, I changed the number of checkers to 2 for an average of the average wait time 
being about 3.8 minutes and only an idle time of 174 minutes which is the lowest I could get
it before the wait times got too large. I also randomized the time it takes a new customer to 
come in to be a random number of minutes from 1 to 5. I also added a way to process how many
total customers came by during the simulation and print it. The last thing I did was change the 
number of items people get to a random number between 5 and 50. This helps maintain a bit more
realism for the simulation. I learned how to consider and manipulate many variables on code and
make them all come together in the end to process and display the data.
